Terrorborn is a WIP content mod for Terraria which adds in many pieces of lore to the game, as well as a WIP storyline that will grow as the mod gains content. As a terror incarnate, shriek and abuse the fear of your victims as you fight for a greater good and fight your way through many new challenging bosses and environments.

The mod’s initial release will add:
 • 4 new challenging bosses each with a purpose at their point in progression and a storyline reason for existing
 • 1 new mechanic: Terror
 • At least 7 new terrifying abilities for you to master and utilize in exploring and combat
 • A WIP storyline that will grow as the mod gains more content
 • 2 new NPCs with unique and useful functions
 • Over 100 new items, each with a unique purpose or effect
 • The lore of the mod will be findable in-game and expand as the mod updates. That's right- no having to look at the wiki to find the lore

--Details--
The Terrorborn mod by Penumbral and numerous other people is an ambitious content mod with the goal of adding an engaging storyline and greatly increasing the quality of combat, primarily through a new mechanic; terror.
Unlock new abilities, face difficult but fair boss encounters, master a new style of combat, and most importantly, have fun, in a refreshing souls like inspired experience.

Content:
 • 7 new challenging-but-fair bosses
 • Terror: Shriek to reap fear from your foes when you get the opportunity, and unleash devastating new spells.
 • 9 horrific abilities that make use of the terror mechanic.
 • 4 new NPCs with unique and useful functions. Each NPC has its own purpose and personality, as well as a backstory that you can learn from.
 • 400+ new items
   • Various new armor sets throughout the game that encourage a variety of playstyles.
   • Many new accessories.
   • New types of accessories and gear, including new ways of handling movement.
   • MANY new weapons to choose from
 • The lore of the mod is findable in-game and will expand as the mod updates.
 • Post-Moon Lord content. Not a lot of it right now, but it's definitely enough to make the finale of your playthrough memorable.

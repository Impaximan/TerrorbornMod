WARNING: This mod does not support multiplayer and likely never will. It is highly recommended that you play this mod on a large world.
The Terrorborn mod by Penumbral and numerous other people is an ambitiously-planned out content mod with the goal of adding an engaging storyline and greatly increasing the quality of combat, primarily through a new mechanic; terror.
Unlock new abilities, face difficult but fair boss encounters, master a new style of combat, and most importantly, have fun, in a refreshing souls like inspired experience.

More details on what the mod adds
 • 8 new challenging-but-fair bosses
 • 1 new mechanic: Terror. Shriek to reap fear from your foes when you get the opportunity, and unleash devastating new spells.
 • 9 horrific abilities that make use of the terror mechanic.
 • 4 new NPCs with unique and useful functions. Each NPC has its own purpose and personality, as well as a backstory that you can learn from.
 • 300+ new items
   • Various new armor sets throughout the game that encourage a variety of playstyles.
   • Many new accessories.
   • New types of accessories and gear, including new ways of handling movement.
   • MANY new weapons to choose from
 • The lore of the mod is findable in-game and will expand as the mod updates.
 • Post-Moon Lord content. Not a lot of it right now, but it's definitely enough to make the finale of your playthrough memorable.

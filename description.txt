--Details--
The Terrorborn mod, developed by Penumbral with the help an extremely friendly dev team (credited below) is a souls-like inspired, ambitious content mod with the goal of adding a not only interesting but also engaging storyline and adding a refreshing slate-gray coat of paint to combat. Tinker with brand new abilities, new types of accessories, new mechanics, and even a new difficulty mode- this mod offers plenty of replayability and more to come with future updates!

Content:
 • 6 new challenging-but-fair bosses
 • Terror: Shriek to reap fear from your foes when you get the opportunity, and unleash devastating new spells.
 • 9 horrific abilities that make use of the terror mechanic.
 • 4 new NPCs with unique and useful functions. Each NPC has its own purpose and personality, as well as a backstory that you can learn from.
 • 400+ new items
   • Various new armor sets throughout the game that encourage a variety of playstyles.
   • Many new accessories.
   • New types of accessories and gear, including new ways of handling movement.
   • MANY new weapons to choose from
 • The lore of the mod is findable in-game and will expand as the mod updates.
 • Many new soundtracks!
 • WIP Post-Moon Lord content.
 • 1 new menu style

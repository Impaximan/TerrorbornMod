WARNING: This mod does not support multiplayer and likely never will. It is highly recommended that you play this mod on a large world.
The Terrorborn mod by Penumbral and numerous other people is an ambitiously-planned out content mod with the goal of adding an engaging storyline and greatly increasing the quality of combat, primarily through a new mechanic; terror.
Unlock new abilities, face difficult but fair boss encounters, master a new style of combat, and most importantly, have fun, in a refreshing souls like inspired experience.

More details on what the mod adds
 • 8 new challenging bosses, made to challenge players more than vanilla whilst simultaneously being more fair and enjoyable. 2 of the new bosses are fought after the Moon Lord himself!
 • 1 new mechanic: Terror. Shriek to reap fear from your foes when you get the opportunity, and unleash devastating new spells.
 • 9 horrific abilities that make use of the terror mechanic. Try out their various aspects and master each one for far better efficiency in combat.
 • A WIP storyline that will grow as the mod gains more content- all of the lore will be available to you in-game! Looking into it might give you some hints as to what's to come.
 • 4 new NPCs with unique and useful functions. Each NPC has its own purpose and personality, as well as a backstory that you can learn from.
 • Over 300 new items.
   • Various new armor sets throughout the game that encourage a variety of playstyles. We promise that not one set bonus will simply be lazy stat changes!
   • New types of weapons have been added, including a new subclass for mage.
   • Many new accessories. At any point in the game there are useful accessory options from Terrorborn; your gear can almost always be fresh.
   • New types of accessories and gear, including new ways of handling movement.
 • The lore of the mod will be findable in-game and expand as the mod updates. That's right- no having to look at the wiki to find the lore.
 • Post-Moon Lord content. Not a lot of it right now, but it's definitely enough to make the finale of your playthrough memorable.

[h1] Welcome to Terrorborn! [/h1]
The Terrorborn mod, developed by Penumbral with the help an extremely friendly dev team (credited below) is a souls-like inspired, ambitious content mod with the goal of adding a not only interesting but also engaging storyline and adding a refreshing slate-gray coat of paint to combat. Tinker with brand new abilities, new types of accessories, new mechanics, and even a new difficulty mode- this mod offers plenty of replayability and more to come with future updates!

[h1] Specifics [/h1]
As of currently, the mod adds the following new content:
[list]
    [*]6 new challenging-but-fair bosses
    [*]Terror (new resource): Shriek to reap fear from your foes when you get the opportunity, and unleash devastating new spells.
    [*]9 horrific new abilities that make use of the terror mechanic.
    [*]4 new "town" NPCs with unique and useful functions. Each NPC has its own unique purpose and personality, as well as a backstory that you can learn from.
    [*]400+ new items, including new types of accessories, weapons, etc.
    [*]Almost every armor set has a unique set bonus
    [*]The lore of the mod is viewable in-game and will expand as the mod updates.
    [*]WIP Post-Moon Lord content
    [*]Many new soundtracks!
    [*]1 new menu style
    [*]A WIP new difficulty mode designed for players who have already played the mod and want to challenge their terror knowledge on repeat playthroughs
